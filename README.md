# About Me Chat-bot

This chat-bot was developed with Next.js and TypeScript for the front-end. It uses the Cohere API, which provides free AI tools for developers, to classify questions and find the best possible answer.

## How It Works

Simply type a question about me in the chat and the bot will give you the best possible answer. The question classification is done through the Cohere API, which is trained with a dataset of specific questions and answers about me.
